# ipl_score_data_analysis
Data Science and Machine Learning project on analysis of IPL Score to predict future performance of the teams.
The project includes extensive use of efficient Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib etc. NumPy arrays that facilitated advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of team data such as the number of matches ever played by any IPL cricket team, their scores, wickets, batsman, bowlers, venues etc. By extracting the info, checking for <strong> null/void values, dropping the nugatory data, seeking correlation among the data terms, plotting of heat map, and then observing the multicollinearity, encoding the categorical columns using pd.get_dummies, observing cardinality, then using the label encoder for specific data sets, splitting the data into training and testing sets, performing the standardization on the train and test sets  </strong> and many more steps to finally plotting statical graphs to predict the score.
